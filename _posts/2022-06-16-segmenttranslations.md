[Dictatorship of the Proletariat in Gotham City | Slavoj Žižek on ‘The Dark Knight Rises’]: https://blogdaboitempo.com.br/2012/08/08/dictatorship-of-the-proletariat-in-gotham-city-slavoj-zizek-on-the-dark-knight-rises/

> However, even if Bane lacks the fascination of Heath Ledger’s Joker, there is a feature which distinguishes him from the latter: unconditional love, the very source of his hardness. In a short but touching scene, we see how, in an act of love in the midst of terrible suffering, Bane saved the child Talia, not caring for consequences and paying a terrible price for it (he was beaten within an inch of his life while defending her). Karthick is totally justified in locating this event into the long tradition, from Christ to Che Guevara, which extols violence as a “work of love,” as in the famous lines from Che Guevara’s diary: “Let me say, with the risk of appearing ridiculous, that the true revolutionary is guided by strong feelings of love. It is impossible to think of an authentic revolutionary without this quality.”<sup>[10]</sup> What we encounter here is not so much the “Christification of Che” but rather a “Cheization” of Christ himself – the Christ whose “scandalous” words from Luke (“if anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and his mother, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters – yes even his own life – he cannot be my disciple”(14:26)) point in exactly the same direction as Che’s famous quote: “You may have to be tough, but do not lose your tenderness.”<sup>[11]</sup> The statement that “the true revolutionary is guided by a great feeling of love” should be read together with Guevara’s much more “problematic” statement on revolutionaries as “killing machines”:

> “Hatred is an element of struggle; relentless hatred of the enemy that impels us over and beyond the natural limitations of man and transforms us into effective, violent, selective, and cold killing machines. Our soldiers must be thus; a people without hatred cannot vanquish a brutal enemy.”<sup>[12]</sup>

> Or, to paraphrase Kant and Robespierre yet again: love without cruelty is powerless; cruelty without love is blind, a short-lived passion which loses its persistent edge. Guevara is here paraphrasing Christ’s declarations on the unity of love and sword – in both cases, the underlying paradox is that what makes love angelic, what elevates it over mere unstable and pathetic sentimentality, is its cruelty itself, its link with violence – it is this link which raises love over and beyond the natural limitations of man and thus transforms it into an unconditional drive. This is why, back to The Dark Knight Rises, the only authentic love in the film is Bane’s, the “terrorist’s,” in clear contrast to Batman.

然而，即使Bane缺乏Heath Ledger的小丑的吸引力，有一项特质将他区别于后者：无条件的爱，也正是他的不屈的源头。在一幕短暂却动人的场景中，我们看见了可怕苦难中的一次爱之行为——Bane如何拯救了孩童时的Talia，不在乎后果并为之付出了极糟的代价（在保护她时他几乎被打死）。Karthick完全正当地把这一事件置于那从基督到切·格瓦拉的，将暴力称颂为“爱的事业”的悠久传统之中，正如切·格瓦拉日记中的著名话语：“或许会显得可笑，但让我说，一个真正的革命者是被强烈的爱的感受所引导的。不可能想象出一位没有这一特质的真实的革命者。”我们在此所见的并非“切的基督化”而是基督自身的一种“切化”——那个在路加福音中“口出狂言”的基督，他的言语（“如果一个来到我身边的人并不憎恨他的父母，他的妻儿，他的手足——是的，甚至他自身的生命——他就无法成为我的门徒”（14:26））指向与切的著名语录完全一致的方向：“你也许不得不变得强硬，但不要丢失你的温柔。”“真正的革命者是被强烈的爱的感受所引导的”这一说法应当与切·格瓦拉关于作为“杀戮机器”的革命者的更“有问题”的言论一起阅读：

“恨意是斗争的一种元素；对敌人不饶恕的恨意驱使我们超越人的自然界限并将我们转变成高效的，暴力的，选择性的以及冷酷的杀戮机器。我们的战士必须如此；一个没有恨意的人无法征服一位残暴的敌人。”

或者，再次重述康德和罗伯斯庇尔：失去了残酷的爱是无力的，失去了爱的残酷是盲目的，一种失去了它不懈的边缘的短暂激情。格瓦拉在此处重述了基督对于爱与利刃的统一性的宣言——在这两种情况下，正是这一根本的悖论构成了天使般的爱，抬升它越过那只是反复无常的多愁善感的是它的残酷本身，它与暴力的联系——是这一联系使它高于并超越了人的自然界限，因而将它变为一种无条件的驱动力。

> Then, one should demystify the problem of violence, rejecting simplistic claims that the XXth century Communism used too much excessive murderous violence, and that we should be careful not to fall into this trap again. As a fact, this is, of course, terrifyingly true, – but such a direct focus on violence obfuscates the underlying question: what was wrong in the XXth century Communist project as such, which immanent weakness of this project pushed Communist to resort the Communists (not only those) in power to unrestrained violence? In other words, it is not enough to say that Communists “neglected the problem of violence”: it was a deeper socio-political failure which pushed them to violence. (The same goes for the notion that Communists “neglected democracy”: their overall project of social transformation enforced on them this “neglect.”) It is thus not only Nolan’s film which was not able to imagine authentic people’s power – the “real” radical-emancipatory movements themselves also were not able to do it, they remained caught in the coordinates of the old society, which is why the actual “people’s power” often was such a violent horror.

由此，应当对暴力的问题去神秘化，拒绝对于二十世纪共产主义用了太多过量的谋杀暴力的简单指控，并且我们应当警惕不再掉入这一陷阱。当然，作为一项事实，这真实得可怕，但对于暴力如此直接的关注忽视了根本的问题：二十世纪的共产主义运动在哪里出了错，是哪一项内在的弱点将共产主义者推向了求助于当权的（不仅是）共产主义者们无限使用暴力？换言之，说共产主义者“忽视了暴力的问题”是不够的：是更深刻的社会政治失败把他们推向了暴力。（认为共产主义者“忽视了民主”的概念与之同理：他们的改造社会的整体运动将这一“忽视”强加于他们。）不仅是诺兰的电影无法想象真正的人民力量——那些“真正的”激进解放运动也无力做到，它们仍被困于旧社会的坐标中，这正是为什么现实的“人民的力量”常常是这样一种暴力的恐怖。
